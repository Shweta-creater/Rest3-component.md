## REST API Testing


*REST API Testing is open-source web automation testing technique that is used for testing RESTful APIs for web applications.* 

*The purpose of rest api testing is to record the response of rest api by sending various HTTP/S requests to check if rest api is* 

*working fine or not. Rest api testing is done by GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods.* 

*Rest stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style and an approach for communication used in the* 

*development of Web Services. REST has become a logical choice for building APIs. It enables users to connect and interact with cloud services efficiently.*

*An API or Application Programming Interface is a set of programming instructions for accessing a web-based software application.
In other words, a set of commands used by an individual program to communicate with one another directly and use each other's functions to get information.*

*For example, a Google website can have API for various functions like search, translations, calendars, etc.*

*In general API's are like below, they have server name, paths.., etc*

*http://<server name>/v1/export/Publisher/Standard_Publisher_Report?format=csv*
  

  <em>There are mainly 4 methods involve in API Testing like GET, POST, Delete, and PUT.</em> 
  
  ## GET- 
  ###GET method is used to extract information from the given server using a given URI. While using GET request, it should                   only extract data and should have no other effect on the data.
