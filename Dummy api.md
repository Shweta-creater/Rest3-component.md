# Rest API Testing

REST API Testing is open-source web automation testing technique that is used for testing RESTful APIs for web applications. The purpose of rest api testing is to record the response of rest api by sending various HTTP/S requests to check if rest api is working fine or not. Rest api testing is done by GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods.
